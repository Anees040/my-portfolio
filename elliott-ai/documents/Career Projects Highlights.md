# Bryan Elliott \- Career Projects Highlights:

Here are some of my career highlights that I’m most proud of (from oldest to most recent):

1. **Graduate Tracker at Narconon Fresh Start:**  
   - While leadership debated whether to build a CRM-style graduate tracking and follow-up system, I took the initiative and built an MVP after hours in my free time, in just 3 days\! When I presented it to leadership, they were stunned. The tool was immediately adopted and led to a 4% increase in repeat sales, while unlocking key business metrics that were previously inaccessible.  
   - **Core technologies used**: Laravel (PHP, MySQL), HTML 5, Materialize CSS, jQuery, Hosted on Digital Ocean droplet.  
2. **Real-Time Call Analytics App at Narconon Fresh Start:**  
   - After identifying inefficiencies in our call center operations, I conceptualized and developed a real-time call analytics app as a side-project, on my own time. Once completed, leadership adopted it into call center operations immediately.  It dramatically transformed how the business operated, improving sales, reducing costs, and giving leadership real-time insight into call center performance.  
   - **Core technologies used**: PHP, MySQL, HTML 5, SCSS, jQuery, Grunt task runner, Hosted on Digital Ocean droplet.  
3. **Refactored Facial Recognition Script at FaceCake:**  
   - Our core facial recognition AI interface script was so complex that most devs avoided touching it. I took it on as a side quest and completely refactored it into a modular, maintainable JavaScript library. This cut new product development time nearly in half and enabled faster iteration across the board.  
   - **Core technologies used**: Vanilla Javascript, Webpack  
4. **Core Contributor to Jetpack AI at Automattic:**  
   - I was part of the core team that built and launched Automattic’s first AI product, Jetpack AI. I shipped many of the frontend UI flows in React/TypeScript for the AI client.  
   - **Core technologies used**: React, TypeScript, Tanstack Query, SCSS, React Testing Library, Storybook  
5. **Connect-after-Checkout Flow at Automattic:**  
   - I conceptualized and implemented the “Connect-after-checkout” flow, which reduced checkout abandonment by 68%, reduced related support tickets by 41%, and lowered product churn by 7%. It remains a key part of the WordPress.com checkout experience to this day.  
   - **Core technologies used**: PHP, React, TypeScript  
6. **License-Based Checkout Flow at Automattic:**  
   - I led the development of a major checkout system upgrade that enabled license-based purchases without requiring a WordPress.com account at purchase time. It resulted in a 4% increase in total cash sales and continues to power key parts of both the WordPress.com and Jetpack checkout systems.  
   - **Core technologies used**: PHP, MySQL, Composer, React, TypeScript, Redux, Tanstack Query

## Other/Personal Projects

1. **AlphaListNav.js:**  
- alphaListNav.js is an open source vanilla JavaScript plugin that will add an alphabetical navigation bar to your long HTML lists. Click a letter in the nav to quickly filter the list to show items that match that letter. With many different options and features.  
  AlphaListNav has very similar functionality to jQuery ListNav but has been re-written without the jQuery dependency. It can serve as a drop-in replacement, removing the need for jQuery.  
2. **ImageAtomizer.js:** 
- [ImageAtomizer.js](http://ImageAtomizer.js) is a small JavaScript library that takes any image and explodes it into thousands of animated particles that gracefully come together to form the image again. The particles repel from the mouse pointer creating an interactive particle animation effect.  
  I wrote a blog post explaining all about it and how I built it here: [Transforming Particles Into An Image ✨ (Meet](https://blog.elliottprogrammer.com/transforming-particles-into-an-image-meet-imageatomizer-js/) [imageAtomizer.js](http://imageAtomizer.js)[)](https://blog.elliottprogrammer.com/transforming-particles-into-an-image-meet-imageatomizer-js/)  
3. **Level Up Mini-Game:**  
- Level up is a sort-of mini-game built with JavaScript and the HTML Canvas API. You jump the elliottprogrammer character up the ascending levels, collecting orbs, until he reaches the top and “Levels-Up\!”  Complete with idle-sprite animation, jumping animation, and cheering/celebrating animation when he reaches the top.  
  I wrote a blog post explaining all about it and how I built it here: [🕹️ Always Leveling Up: Building My Own Mini Game (and My Skills) as a Full-Stack Engineer](https://blog.elliottprogrammer.com/always-leveling-up-building-my-own-mini-game-and-my-skills-as-a-full-stack-engineer/)
