## My Favorite, Most Impactful Engineering Project That I’m Most Proud Of:

One of my favorite, most impactful, and challenging engineering projects was leading and implementing the **license-based checkout flow** project at Automattic. We identified that a significant number of users were abandoning checkout because they were required to create or log into a WordPress.com account before purchasing. I stepped up as the lead engineer to design and deliver a solution that allowed users to complete purchases while logged out and activate their product later via a license key.

My role combined technical leadership, project facilitation, and hands-on execution. I planned and scoped the project, estimated timelines, and coordinated a team of four engineers across a nearly five-month effort. To reduce risk and maintain momentum, I broke the work into three independently shippable milestones, each with clear epics, stories, and deliverables. This approach gave the team clarity at every phase and allowed us to validate progress incrementally.

From an engineering standpoint, the most interesting challenge was enabling license-based purchases without re-building a parallel checkout or subscription system. I designed a solution that reused our existing site-centric subscription infrastructure by introducing a temporary backend “site” entity for logged-out purchases and using the license key as the primary identifier. When a customer later activated their license, the subscription (attached to the temporary “site”) was seamlessly transferred to their actual intended site. This minimized scope, preserved existing business logic, and reduced long-term maintenance risk.

The project was especially challenging because the checkout system was deeply dependent on `user\_id` and `site\_id` variables. Since licensed-based purchases take place while users are logged-out, these `user\_id` and `site\_id` values won’t be available to us, so refactoring this safely required auditing and restructuring hundreds of frontend and backend touchpoints without breaking the experience for logged-in users. I placed heavy emphasis on pre-planning and test coverage, mapping the full refactor path before implementation, while also contributing significantly to the code myself throughout the project.

This project stands out as my favorite because it combined meaningful business impact with deep technical problem-solving and team leadership. We shipped on time, reduced checkout abandonment by 68%, and the system remains a core part of WordPress.com’s checkout today. It was a rewarding example of making thoughtful tradeoffs between user experience, technical constraints, and business goals at scale.
