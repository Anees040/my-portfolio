    * Robert Sreberski's recommendation to All LinkedIn members:  
      * Bryan is an exceptionally talented engineer whose technical depth and commitment to quality stood out during our time together at Automattic. His comprehensive understanding of our complex technical systems allowed him to create solutions that seamlessly integrated across multiple codebases, consistently delivering features that made meaningful impacts for both our users and business outcomes.  <br /><br />What truly sets Bryan apart is his remarkable balance of pragmatic decision-making with forward-thinking architecture. While many engineers excel at solving immediate problems, Bryan consistently built solutions that stood the test of time \- his implementation patterns were so effective that they were later adopted across other projects. His development of the Connect-after-checkout flow, which measurably decreased abandonment rates, exemplifies how he transforms technical excellence into tangible business results. <br /><br />I've been particularly impressed by Bryan's user-centered approach to development. He doesn't just build features to specification \- he advocates for enhanced user experiences, identifies opportunities for improvement, and thinks deeply about how people will actually interact with his work. This empathy for users, combined with his methodical problem-solving abilities, results in solutions that address both immediate needs and long-term strategic goals. <br /><br />As a collaborator, Bryan contributes significantly to team culture through his thoughtful code reviews, clear technical documentation, and willingness to help unblock colleagues. His ability to communicate complex technical concepts in accessible ways strengthens the entire team's understanding and effectiveness. <br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend Bryan for engineering roles where technical depth, quality-focused delivery, and pragmatic problem-solving are valued. Any team would benefit tremendously from his expertise, collaborative spirit, and commitment to creating technology that truly serves users.
