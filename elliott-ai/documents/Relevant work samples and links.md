**Relevant Work Samples and Important Links**

The majority of the frontend code I developed over the last 5 years at Automattic Inc was in large open-source projects, supporting millions of users such as Automattic/calypso (the WordPress.com user dashboard) and Automattic/jetpack (a popular family of WordPress plugins). I authored and merged hundreds of pull requests into production across these codebases.  You can view all of these pull-requests on Github (The first 2 links below).
