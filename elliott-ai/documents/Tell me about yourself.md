# Tell me about yourself

* My name is Bryan Elliott  
* I have over 15 years experience working professionally, building out scalable, maintainable, and performant web applications.  
* I would consider myself a full-stack developer, being adept at both the backend and frontend, however I specialize in frontend development, and for that reason I call myself a “frontend-leaning” full-stack developer/engineer. I have a deep passion for the JavaScript programming language– Typescript, and React. In the backend I am most comfortable working with PHP, MySQL, and Node.js.  
* Most recently, I spent nearly five years at Automattic, where I led the development of many high-impact projects for products like Jetpack and WordPress.com. That included everything from architecture, technical planning, time estimation to implementation- developing the logic and building out the React UI that was used by millions of users.  
*  I also worked cross-functionally with designers, marketers, and product managers to align our engineering efforts with business goals.  
* A majority of the frontend code I wrote during my time at Automattic was all open-source, so a lot of what I worked on (and the code I wrote) is publicly available on GitHub and is still live in production.  
* I’m a self-starter and can work independently (as I did for Two Sigma), but I particularly value working with a team (like at Automattic). I strive to influence my team not just through code, but through knowledge sharing, improving team processes, and continuous collaboration and learning.
